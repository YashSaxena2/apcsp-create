        The stock market in the United States is comprised of three major stock exchanges: American Stock Exchange (AMEX), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASDAQ). These exchanges serve as hubs where people can 
        buy and sell <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp">shares</a>, or fractional ownership, of companies. Each stock has a unique "ticker", which is a symbol comprised of capitalized letters that is unique to a company. StockSearcher allows you
        to input these unique tickers and within seconds get the price per share and much more about any company listed on major exchanges.

        One of the terms you may find when you search for a stock is "52 week high". This term refers to the maximum price of the stock during the past 52 weeks (one year). Similarly, the term "52 week low" refers to the minimum price of the stuck during the past 52 weeks (one year).
        Another term StockSearcher displays is the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/target-prices-and-sound-investing/">analyst price target</a>. This price is a target price prediction made by stock market analysts for the stock in the future. Although this price is useful in determining sentiment around a stock, 
        it is not a foolproof, and should not be used alone when evaluating a company. A high analyst price target does not necessarily mean the stock will rise in the future.
